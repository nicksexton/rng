Random Number Generation
===

supervisory system - random number generation model

Simulation 3 - simulating the effects of individual differences in number schemas on RNG
Uses same assumtions about working memory as Simulation 2
hypothesis - differences in schema selection weights matrix (reflecing the likelihood of each schema's selection, given the current schema) should modulate RNG index
